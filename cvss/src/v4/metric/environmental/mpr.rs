/// Described in CVSS v4.0 Specification: Section 4.2
///
/// > This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess
/// > prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which
/// > the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g.,
/// > free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally,
/// > self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege
/// > requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the
